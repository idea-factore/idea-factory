new idea:

Iteration on previous ideas

Base token is called IDEA:

functions: 

can deposit collateral into IDEA, withdraw etc (which, when using AAVE, mints or burns new IDEA tokens)

can create a subtoken with a starting value of 0% of IDEA value (or the value of collateral in IDEA). This subtoken is supposed to be for an idea but I guess it in theory could be for whatever. LP's or owners of IDEA, can vote on the subtoken which will increase the perecentage or ratio value based on voting power of LP
NON-LPS can buy this subtoken which makes you an LP of the subtoken? maybe? or somemthing like that. Irregardless, it supports the development of whatever the subidea is for. Users can also contribute to the subtoken, which will give that user a certain amount of the subtoken based on voting by all holders of subtoken and LP's which voted for subtoken as well as the creator of subtoken. If the subtoken isn't going anywheres, LP's and holders of subtoken can vote to liquidate the subtoken and gain back money + interest (based on amount of time they staked subtoken?)


Uses Aave (duh), and probably chainlink or something idk, maybe ens
