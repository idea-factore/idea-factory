Contract implementation v0.01 :)

* create governance token called IDEA
* allow LP's to deposite collateral (in the form of aave, most likely) into IDEA which will grant them a certain number of IDEA tokens
* These ideas tokens can then be used to vote on startups in order to distrbute the funding pool
* Ideas that are added, are stored as a subtoken of IDEA, with a price that will either be set through a bonding curve (where the max price has to be equal or below the total funding pool), or simply a percentage of IDEA, determined through voting and voting power
* Goal is that the value of startup (in terms of the subtoken) is expressed in terms of the amount of the amount of collateral that the startup is receiving but maybe it should be express in terms of the theoritical worth of the startup as determined by LP votes, and other users who buy the subtoken (unclear, probably outside scope)
* Ability for LP to retreive collateral from IDEA + a certain amount of interest that is accrued by being locked in. 
* Ability for all users and LP's who have invested in a startup to liqudate the startup if they feel the projects goals aren't being met (decided through vote). In this case, LP's and users would gain their capital back, along with contributors (outside scope?), but startup creators would lose and could have some sort of debt.

* some sort of credit delegation which im not sure about?
